The figure stands before the fountain, their hood lowered to reveal piercing eyes that seem to glow with an otherworldly light.\n\n\"I've been expecting you,\" the figure speaks softly, their voice carrying a hint of mystery and danger. \"You have a role to play in the unfolding events of Valoria. Will you embrace your destiny, or will you turn away from the path that lies ahead?\"\n\nWhat will your response be to this enigmatic figure in the secluded courtyard of Valoria?"
