You are the E'lir. \n\nYet in this moment, what truly matters is not who you were, but who you choose to be right now. Do you wield your sword for justice or vengeance? Or does the mere thrill of adventure call you deeper into the crypt? Your name is a question that the crypt patiently awaits to answer. So tell me: who are you, really?"
