In the distance, the hoot of an owl punctuates the stillness. Towering mountains loom ominously over the landscape, their jagged peaks scraping the underbelly of the star-splattered night sky.*\n\n*An aging adventurer, scarred by countless battles, steps onto the forbidding path ahead. He is cloaked in heavy furs, the chill air making his breath visible in the pale light. In his hand, he grips a silver-handled sword, its blade glistening ominously. This is a man who has seen the trials and tribulations life can offer, yet shows no signs of weary retreat.*\n\n*Here in the heart of the Dark Ford, the night is a constant companion, an enigma that sweeps over the land and engulfs it in a blanket of darkness. As the adventurer delves deeper into the vale, he cannot help but feel the prickle of watchful eyes on his back. The silent inhabitants of the forest lurk just beyond vision, their intentions hidden in the obscurity.*\n\n*Welcome to a world where the line between humanity and monstrosity blurs, where fear forges the greatest heroes, and the most profound mysteries are clad in shadow. For it is into this realm of beauty and decay, into the shadowed vale, that our brave adventurer plunges...*\n"

Your early years were spent hidden away in Highmoor Forest, learning the symphony of the wild, tracking beasts and understanding the language of the tree leaves whispering in the wind. You carry the mark of the forest on your skin, etched deep in the form of an oak leaf tattoo. \n\nRejuvenated by the thrilling danger of the wilderness, you exude a refreshing kind of bravery, refusing to be daunted by any of the terrors or perils you confront. You're a renowned hunter, unmatched with a bow and arrow. Your quick thinking and agility provide you leverage in your encounters with the more dangerous aspects of the wild.\n\nYour journey so far has left you scarred but instilled with a wisdom that often aids you in dire times. Despite your experience and skill, you have a pervasive sense of humility that endears you to many. You have learned to listen to the earth, the wind, the trees, and the beasts – and this deep connection to the natural realm guides your path.\n\nDriven by curiosity and thirst for new experiences, you find yourself compelled to explore the darker places of the world, despite the danger they present. There is a particular fascination for the untamed corners of the Dark Ford that keeps drawing you back.\n\nMutually respectful relationships with a myriad of fellow adventurers and inhabitants offer you a safety net of alliances, but your solitary nature often pulls you back into the wild solitude of the forest. \n\nYour resolve is made of diamond, sturdy and beautiful in all its splendour. As you venture forth in a world shrouded in shadow, your courage shines brighter than the keenest blade."

Its sheath is well-worn leather, the blade within nicked and scarred from countless battles, yet it remains as sharp as ever.\n\nYou pull out a small vial filled with a murky red liquid. It's the healing potion given to you by the forest witch in the outskirts of Highmoor, to be used in only the direst of circumstances. Beside it is a leather-bound journal filled with notes from your past adventures, a map of the known world folded and tucked in its last pages.\n\nYou feel the cool to touch stone, a gift from the river naiad, embedded with intricate carvings decipherable to only those who know the secret language of water spirits. It hums softly with latent magical power.\n\nAmong the smaller items, you find your Flint and steel, for the vital spark to ignite your campfire at night; a length of rope, strong and weather resilient; a bedroll, for when you need to rest your weary head; a waterskin filled with fresh water; rations for three days, and a few gold pieces carefully preserved for emergencies.\n\nLastly, tucked away in a secret compartment is your most prized possession: a small, beautifully crafted carving of an oak tree -- a reminder of your humble beginnings."

A pulse of divine energy sweeps across the vale, each wave bending reality and sending sparks of multicolored light dancing across the landscape.\n\nBefore Eolan, the etchings in the stone roadway shimmer with enchantment, revealing a series of divine symbols – a pathway, a key, and an eye. \n\nAbove him, the heavens light up, the astral bodies condensing into an eerily beautiful map. The pathway symbol aligns with a constellation, the key towards a star pulsating with unearthly colors, and the eye, the North star, casts its steady gaze towards the looming castle far beyond.\n\nThe immediate power recedes as the echo of your call fades.

The image illuminates a potential trail beyond what your eyes can perceive, a heavenly path defying earthly constraints.\n\nAnd then there's the North Star, steady and unblinking in its glowing brightness, directed towards the undeniable silhouette of the ancient castle looming ominously in the distance. It is as if the eye of the cosmos itself guides you towards your destination.\n\nThe world feels different now; with divine influence altering your senses, the vale seems less like an ominous shadow and more like a mystical terrain ripe for exploration.

They're clad in mismatched armors, their faces hardened by countless adventures, their eyes constantly scanning their surroundings. Two nimble and quick-eyed archers, a burly swordsman, a cloaked rogue, and a weather-beaten figure who appears to take the role of the spell-caster - a typical band of adventurers, much like Eolan has encountered before.\n\nA couple of horses stand tied to a nearby tree, their sides rising and falling in a continuous rhythm. On temporary racks, bits of gear and provisions lie scattered around, a silent testament to their semi-nomadic lifestyle.\n\nTheir conversation softens as they notice your approach.
