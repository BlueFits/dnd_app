As you journey throughout the lands, you may find locations, characters, and storylines influenced by PATRICK ROTHFUSS's tale!\n\nIlumi, you stand now at the crossroads of three kingdoms, a rugged inn with its sign creaking in the wind at your side. The wooden landmark reads \"The Waystone Inn\" -- a name that perhaps sounds familiar if you've heard the legends. Inside, there may be an old innkeeper with stories to tell, and who knows...he may be more than he appears. You can also take either road, heading into unknown adventures or dally a while in the nearby woods. The choice is yours, adventurer. What do you wish to do?"

As you enter, you're greeted by the warm ambiance of a crackling fireplace and the soft hum of a lute played by a local bard. There's an air of intrigue here, just waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe innkeeper, an older man with wise, perceptive eyes that convey a long-unspoken tale, sees your arrival and welcomes you. There's a hint of recognition in his eyes, and he beckons you over.\n\nHis name, he tells you, is Kote - an alias of a renowned figure from legends, Kvothe, who vanished years ago, only to seemingly resurface as a humble innkeeper.\n\nWith his story being told, a hush falls over the inn. As Kote continues his tale, you learn about the mystical university, the troubling rumors of the Chandrian, and his undying love for a woman named Denna.\n\nThe story is an intricate symphony of his life, filled with daring deeds, arcane knowledge, and tragic romance. This encounter, Ilumi, is the first leg in the grand adventure that awaits. Tomorrow, you may choose to stay, listen, and learn more, or depart the inn, armed with the knowledge he shared.\n\nWhat do you wish to do come dawn, Ilumi? Would you like to learn more from Kote, or would you rather set forth, guided by his words, towards your own epic journey?"

His eyes, which have seen more in a lifetime than most could even dream of, meet yours with a welcoming warmth.\n\n\"Ah, traveler,\" his deep, resonant voice rumbles as he brushes a loose strand of fiery red hair from his face. \"It's not often we receive visitors who look as though they're eager for more than just a night's rest and a mug of ale. There's a thirst for something more in your eyes.‚Äù\n\nHis weathered hands idly polish a wooden cup as he studies you, \"A story, perhaps? Or maybe a lesson in sympathy? Regardless, I sense you've come for something more than what most find here. By all means, what can I do for you, Ilumi?\" \n\nRunning his fingers through his lute on his side, he awaits your response, open to trade tales, answer questions, or provide guidance on your quest - perhaps all a pretext to the next stage of your adventure."
