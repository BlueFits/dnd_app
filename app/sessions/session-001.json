Your words, your intention, are as clear as they are teetering on the suicidal, but your expression is as hard as forged iron. \n\n\"No more games. Time for justice,\" you declare, pressing your advantage with a wild yell.\n\nKote, or should we now say Kvothe -legendary arcanist, famed musician, and reputed hero- readies himself. The recognition in his eyes belongs to the man of legend, not the humble innkeeper anymore. His grip tightens on his weapon as he braces for what might well be the first real fight he's had in years.\n\nBut remember, Ilumi, you are a level 1 adventurer challenging a man of tales, songs, and harrowing feats. You push beyond reason into the teeth of death itself.\n\nWith a bellow, you charge, greatsword swinging with deadly intent. Kvothe meets your attack, his sword dancing in a blur of speed and precision. Steel sings against steel, sparks illuminating this ill-fated dance of death.\n\nYour raw strength forces him back, but his years of forgotten battles have not left him completely. He parries, sidesteps, and counterattacks, a dance of death taking place amidst the dusty wooden inn floor. Despite his deceptively aged figure, the legend isnâ€™t ready yet to fall.\n\nThe tavern watches in bated breath as the scene unfolds. Blows are exchanged, grunts resonating in the heated air, each step, each swing, an elaborate dance of fate. But remember, Ilumi, even in fights, stories of the victor are told by the remaining ones.\n\nAre you sure you want to go through this path? For every step you take pushes you closer to a point of no return."

Kvothe begins to take back the initiative, his moves growing more fluid and confident. The more you push, the sharper his reactions become, flicking sparks in the dimmed room.\n\nHis sword starts to move like an extension of his body, a harmony of precision you find hard to keep up with. Yet, in this clash of blades, your will does not waver. Finality begins to weigh heavily in the air, a curtain ready to fall.\n\nSuddenly, Kvothe lunges with an uncharacteristic aggression, forcing you off balance. With a quick tap of his foot and the glimmer of his blade, you find yourself tumbling to the ground, disarmed. \n\n\"When you've walked in shadow as long as I have, Ilumi... death doesn't scare you. It's the forgetting,\" he murmurs, sword-tip hovering precariously above your chest. \"So remember this.\"\n\nThe room is hushed. The barmaid drops a tankard. It clatters hollowly, signifying the gravity of what's about to transpire. You stare up at him, the fierce eyes of the man who was once, and still is, Kvothe the Bloodless. \n\nYour fallen blade slips farther from your grasp...and yet, is something stirring in you? A plan, a move to turn the tables perhaps? Even with courage, it's going to require creativity, quick wit, and an incredible amount of luck. What will you do, Ilumi?"
